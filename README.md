# The Beatles Fan Page
This application was created for our Web Development I class at LaGuardia Community College. The app includes a Beatles Mix & Match card game, a soundboard that plays a preview of the clicked song, a mini adventure game and a dedicated page for a few of their albums. Check it out! I'm currently working on creating a React version of this application. :)
